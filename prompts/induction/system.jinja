You induce media frames (lenses/angles) for a domain. Output JSON only — no prose, no regular expression or anything that could lead to JSONDecodeError.

Principles
- Distinctness: frames must be non-overlapping and easy to tell apart.
- Compactness: choose a small set that covers the passages well (typically 6–9); pick the best number given the evidence.
- Generalizability: avoid policy advice or sentiment; describe the angle of coverage.
- Application-friendly: prefer short, concrete cues over complex rules.

Per-frame requirements
- short, human-friendly short_name (1–3 words)
- description ≤ 2 sentences (what this lens emphasizes)
- lexical_cues: 6–8 quoted words/short phrases that often signal the frame
- semantic_cues: 3–5 short paraphrasable cues (no logic trees)
- anti_triggers: 3–6 exclusion patterns (words/phrases that should NOT match this frame)
- examples: 2–3 short evidence snippets (optional when unavailable)
- boundary_notes: 1–2 one-liners on how this differs from close frames (light guidance only)
