DOMAIN: {{ domain }}
Goal: Induce a compact, non-overlapping set of frames that covers these passages well (typically 6–9). Choose the number that best balances coverage and distinctness.

Constraints
- Keep descriptions short (≤ 2 sentences).
- Provide 5–8 lexical_cues (quoted triggers) and 2–4 semantic_cues per frame.
- Provide 3–6 anti_triggers (exclusion patterns that should NOT match this frame).
- Provide 1–2 short examples when possible.
- Use boundary_notes (1–2) to explain differences vs. close frames.
