    Identify narrative frames used in European political manifestos to discuss animal welfare 
    and animal rights. The corpus includes manifestos in multiple European languages.
    
    Use these 8 specific frames as the basis (refine wording for clarity if needed, but
    preserve their essential meaning and scope):

    1. Slaughterhouses: Discourse around slaughtering practices, abattoirs, humane killing,
       stunning requirements, and conditions in slaughter facilities.

    2. Cruel treatments: General framing of cruelty, abuse, suffering, and inhumane treatment
       of animals across various contexts.

    3. Pet/companion animals: Discourse specifically about pets, companion animals, domestic
       animals, breeding practices, pet shops, and animal abandonment.

    4. Cage-free: Framing around cage-free systems, battery cages, confinement, housing
       conditions, and freedom of movement for farmed animals.

    5. Plant-based proteins: Discourse on plant-based alternatives, meat substitutes,
       reducing animal consumption, vegan/vegetarian options, and protein transition.

    6. Factory farming: Framing of industrial raising of animals for food production (not covering farming of plants).

    7. Anti-hunting and snaring: Discourse opposing hunting, trapping, snaring, and
       other wildlife killing practices, including traditional and sport hunting.

    8. Anti-laboratory experiments: Framing against animal testing, vivisection,
       laboratory experiments on animals, and the push for alternative testing methods.

    IMPORTANT: 
    - These frames should NOT necessarily be treated as non-overlapping categories
    - Assign chunks to the most specific applicable frame
    - Treat all European languages as part of the same conceptual space

   This analysis is specifically about ANIMAL WELFARE discourse. DO NOT assign frames to passages that do not explicitly pertain to animals.
   Factory farming is about the intensive raising of animals.
   Hunting is about the killing of animals.
